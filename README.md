# Android CaptureSDK

Socket Mobile is a leading innovator of data capture and delivery solutions for enhanced productivity.

CaptureSDK is the easiest solution for adding barcode scanning and RFID/NFC reading capability to an Android application.

The Socket Mobile barcode scanner and contactless reader/writer are an ergonomic, fast and accurate solution to a variety of data entry scenarios.

To access our CaptureSDK on all platforms, you can login into our [DEVELOPERS PORTAL](https://www.socketmobile.com/dev-portal/portal)

More documentation can be found [here](https://docs.socketmobile.com/capture/java/en/latest/ "CaptureSDK Documentation").

This SDK is very easy to integrate to an application without requirement to follow a specific design architecture.

Within 10 minutes the barcode scanning or RFID/NFC reading capability can be integrated into an application.

The CaptureSDK offers a built-in barcode scanner called SocketCam, allowing to test and integrate the SDK even before getting a Socket Mobile scanner, using the exact same API, which makes the transition from using SocketCam to a Socket scanner totally frictionless.
